##For this project, I took the following steps to tidy the data:

1) Combine the training and test data using r bind.  

2) Grep the features the file for the keywords "mean" and "std" to narrow down the data.  

3) Merge the activities table with the the bigger data set using a left outer join.  

4) Convert the Subject and Activity fields to factors in order to group the data properly and summarize it.
